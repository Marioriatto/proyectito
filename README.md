    by using heuristics and backtracking this program finds a feasible schedule that satisfies all constraints
    but most importantly it automates administrative tasks reducing worload stress and improving students satisfaction

  <h5>
    infers new information and updates heuristics to find errors earlier and reduce execution time creating a priority queue
